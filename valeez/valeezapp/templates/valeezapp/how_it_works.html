        <p><h3>Valeez uses weather forecasts and predictions to help you pack your suitcase for the 20 most popular destinations in the US.</h3></p>
        <p>To use Valeez, you must have an account and be logged in.  To create a new account, go to the "sign up" link.</p>
        <h4>Nuts and bolts</h4>
        <p>There are two main components of Valeez: weather data and an algorithm to assemble the packing list.</p>
        <p><h5><strong>Weather data</strong></h5></p>
        <p>All weather data in Valeez comes from <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/" target="blank">Weather Underground</a>, and is available for the 20 or so most popular destinations in the US.  Since weather is hard to predict and most forecasts aren't available more than 10 days out, the data used to build the packing list depends on the dates of the voyage:
        <ul>
        	<li>Voyages starting and ending within 10 days use data from a forecast.</li>
        	<li>Voyages that will not be completed within 10 days use planning data based on historical weather patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p><h5><strong>Packing list</strong></h5></p>
        <p>Once the weather data is retrieved from the API, Valeez:
        <ol>
        	<li><strong>Matches the average temperature to one of five categories.</strong>  For example, if the average temperature for a destination is 90 degrees Fahrenheit or more, the voyage is
        	assigned the temperature category of "temp_high".</li>
        	<li><strong>Queries the PostgreSQL database to get records of appropriate garments and toiletries for the Valeez.</strong>The query filters the contents of the database by the temperature category as well as rain and snow probability, and gender as specified by the user.</li>
      		<li><strong>Assigns and displays quantities of items based on the duration of the trip.</strong> Each garment in the database is associated with a layer of clothing as a number from 1 to 5, one being the closest to your skin, like underwear, and five the furthest from your skin, like a coat. The lower the number, the more frequently you'll want to change it and the greater the quantity of the item you'll need to bring.  The suggested quantity is determined by the number of days in the trip, so for a 5 day trip, you'd pack 5 pairs of underwear, but one coat.  Most toiletries are recommended for any trip that includes an overnight stay.</li>
      		<li><strong>Saves the packing list, trip destination and dates in the PostgreSQL database.</strong> This data can be retrieved by the user any time in the "past voyages" section, which is shown in the toolbar when they log in.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p>The site is built using the Django framework, with django-registration-redux for the account creation and password updating functionality.</p>
